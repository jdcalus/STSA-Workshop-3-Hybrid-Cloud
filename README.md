# Workshop 3 Hybrid Heterogeneous Cloud

## Introduction
In this workshop, we’ll work with APIs through Node-RED to use and create services for a weather preparedness situation.

The fictitious company we’re working with is a large retail company that centralizes their core business assets, but still utilizes public cloud APIs to extend their functionality. At the heart of operations is a large key/value store system, which holds information about products as well as inventory information for each store.

This lab uses Node-RED, and you can either use an existing instance, or create a new one. Either way, make note of the instance name so you can easily reference the web page and ReST interfaces.

You may also wish to use a ReST client to test the APIs, and view debug data. Some popular ReST clients include RESTClient for Firefox (http://restclient.net/) and Restlet Client for Chrome (https://restlet.com/modules/client/)

Using a REST client is typically done by specifying the HTTP directive (a GET, for example, which typically requests information) and an address, like this:

![Architecture Overview](/images/rest_client.png)


The important fields to note here are the Method, URL, Response, and Body. The Method is the HTTP verb that is being performed against the HTTP endpoint. For our examples here, we will only be reading data, so we will be performing a GET. For the curious, a POST is typically used to create new objects, PUT is used to update existing objects, and DELETE is used to delete existing objects. There are more verbs, but these are the main four.

Next is the URL, which represents the object we are acting upon. If it looks like a website url, that’s because ReST-ful APIs use HTTP mechanisms to facilitate communication, and that’s essentially what it is; a web address. It probably won’t work if you put it into a web browser, though, it is meant to be called from a client or code that can handle the input and output correctly.

This familiarity is what makes it so easy for just about any programming language to support ReST-ful APIs without the need for specific libraries and connectors. As long as someone’s program can reach out to a web server, it can initiate an API.

The Response is simply the output from the web service. If issuing a GET, this is where you’ll find the requested object. For POST, PUT, and DELETEs, you will most likely only get the response code. Just like HTTP, 200 means OK, everything worked correctly, though some services will pass back additional information that may be helpful to the creator.

When making a POST or PUT, we have to send along the data to be created or updated. This is where we use the Body of a ReST call. For this lab, we will not be making POSTs or PUTs, so we won’t have to worry about this.

## Exercise 1:

We need to begin by putting the starter code into a new Node-RED workspace. This can be done by using the menu button on the top right corner of Node-RED, and then selecting Import -> Clipboard. Paste the code in the editor and make sure to select **new flow**  here and click Import.

![Architecture Overview](/images/import-code.png)


We have two very simple services here. In fact, they're so simple, they do very little beyond what the service they're calling does. We'll start here, however, just so you get a basic understanding of using services to build functionality.

![Architecture Overview](/images/first_two_flows.png)


There are two types of boxes that will help you debug your code throughout this lab;
the Inject box and the Debug box. Clicking the square on the left side of a light-blue
Inject box sends a specific piece of data into a flow. This can be used to emulate a web
call or device input, and can only be used as input sources. The dark green node, called
the Debug node, grabs the values of a particular object and displays it on the Debug panel
on the right side of your screen. Debug nodes can be temporarily deactivated by clicking on
the green square on the right side.   

![Architecture Overview](/images/inject_debug.png)

### Try yourself

  You can try this yourself by dragging each of the nodes (Inject and Debug) into the flow.

  Double click on the **Inject** node and replace the values as follows:

  ![Architecture Overview](/images/inject-hello.png)

  Double click on the debug node and change the name:

  ![Architecture Overview](/images/debug-hello.png)

  Now click on the **Deploy** button at the top of the screen.

  You can now click on the left side of the "Hello World" and you should see the output in the debug panel

  ![Architecture Overview](/images/hello-debug-panel.png)		

### Test Item Lookup

  The first line is a service, and should already work. You can test it and view the debug output using those Inject (Test Item Lookup by name) and Debug (CICS Replies) nodes.   

  Click on the inject button for the "Test Item Lookup"

  ![Architecture Overview](/images/inject-test-item-lookup-node.png)

  Your output in the debug panel should look like:

  ![Architecture Overview](/images/test-item-lookup-debug.png)

### Looking at our own API's
  From an API perspective the flow accepts a GET request, and uses the information in the GET querystring to perform its own GET request to the inventory key/value store, which is running out of CICS. It then simply takes the response and sends it back out to the original requestor.

  By opening the node for the HTTP call **(Company Item Lookup node)** , you can see how the item name is substituted in the url by use of triple curly braces, {{{like.this}}}. This is called "Mustache Syntax". :wavy_dash:

  ![Architecture Overview](/images/http_request.png)

{{{payload.name}}} is the main JSON attribute that is used to pass data between nodes. We saw this in the IoT Lab as well as the Watson Conversation lab.

### Test Store Lookup

Do the same thing for the "Test Store Lookup", by clicking on the **Test Store Lookup** inject node.

What you see is probably not what you expected.

![Architecture Overview](/images/store-lookup-debug.png)

As you can see in the debug panel there is an error "No url specified". This is because the "HTTP Node" is not configured properly.


Double click on the **Store Lookup** node

![Architecture Overview](/images/http-store-lookup-node.png)

This intentionally doesn't work so we need to fix it. The "URL" field was left empty.

![Architecture Overview](/images/http-store-lookup-node-edit.png)


This is because this service performs a slightly different query.

The company uses this service to check on the status of a particular item in a specific store, and they use the following format:

`http://[hostname]]/resources/ecs/IBM/demo/[store prefix]_[item number]`

So, for example, if we wanted to look up the status of an item in the Poughkeepsie, NY store location, we would use the following format:

`http://mvs1.centers.ihost.com:50200/resources/ecs/IBM/demo/poughkeepsieny_8675309`

This translates to the following url format for NodeRed
`http://mvs1.centers.ihost.com:50200/resources/ecs/IBM/demo/{{{payload.storeprefix}}}_{{{payload.itemnumber}}}`

This means that the payload must have two attributes:
1. storeprefix
2. itemnumber


![Architecture Overview](/images/http-request-store-lookup-node.png)

If you look at the inject node for the store lookup you will see that the payload is providing the information needed for the http request.

![Architecture Overview](/images/inject-store-lookup-node.png)

So your two HTTP REST calls should look fairly similar to each other, except that you'll be using the triple-curly-braces to substitute two parameters instead of one. Remember the formatting above.

Click the **done** and then the **Deploy** button.

When completed, you should have two services, and both Test buttons should return something looking like item information from the CICS Replies debug node.

Tip: Don't worry if you see a "No Response Object" warning while testing with the buttons. Since we're calling it from a manual inject, and not an HTTP request, the HTTP response node gets confused, but it'll work just fine when we call it as a real service.

You can also drive these services from a REST client, by using the addresses noted in the HTTP In nodes.

`http://STSAWorkshops-xx.mybluemix.net/inventorylookup`


## Exercise 2:
So far, we've just created two simple services, and they don't do much on their own, but it's time to make a service that provides a little more value.

A fairly common request of a developer would probably be to have an easy way to translate between product names and numbers. We can actually do this in the same service by leveraging what we have already created above.

Copy and paste the code for Exercise #2 below your existing services and take a look at the nodes.

![Architecture Overview](/images/exercise-two-initial-view.png)


Following the flow from left to right. We have an "HTTP In" (Translate Name/Number) node, which we can view as an API endpoint for others to call.
There are also two Test Inject buttons "(generator)" and "(19645922)" which you can use to easily debug your code. These simulate the API being called.
The basic principle of this API is to allow the user to send an "itemID" and get a "product name" in response. or sent a "product name" and get an "ItemID" in response.

Remember we have to ultimately call an API on zOS that looks like:

```
http://[hostname]]/resources/ecs/IBM/demo/[store prefix]_[item number]
or
http://[hostname]]/resources/ecs/IBM/demo/[item_name]
```

Next, if you double click on the "Set store prefix"

![Architecture Overview](/images/set-store-prefix-node.png)

You will see that the we set the "msg.store_prefix" attribute of the JSON object to "sample_store"

![Architecture Overview](/images/set-store-prefix-node-details.png)

We are using  "sample_store" as our store prefix, because data is already populated on zOS for this store prefix.

Next is the "IsNumerical" node. It uses Regex to figure out if the incoming payload is text or numerical.
If it's text (an item name), we will want to make sure the value is passed to the appropriate lookup API. If it is a number we want to make sure it is passed to the proper number lookup API.

If you have a product name and want to get the ItemID use the following lookup API:
```
http://[hostname]]/resources/ecs/IBM/demo/[item_name]
i.e. http://[hostname]]/resources/ecs/IBM/demo/generator
```

If you have an item number and want to get the product name, you need call the inventory lookup:
```
http://[hostname]]/resources/ecs/IBM/demo/[store prefix]_[item number]
i.e. http://mvs1.centers.ihost.com:50200/resources/ecs/IBM/demo/poughkeepsieny_8675309
```
The "isNumerical" node is a **switch** node which allows for the flow to change based on the conditions defined in the switch node details.

![Architecture Overview](/images/isnumerical-node.png)

As you can see in the image below there are two conditions in he "switch node".

![Architecture Overview](/images/isnumerical-node-details.png)

The first condition evaluated is that a number value between 0 and 9999999 is stored in msg.payload.
The second condition is the catch all condition, which in our case says, that if the values in msg.payload are not a number we will pass the data through.

Click **Done** to close the editor.

Now look at the isNumerical node again, you will see two small gray circles on the right of the node.

![Architecture Overview](/images/isnumerical-node.png)

Those two circles correspond to the two condition in the node details. The top circle is used for the number matching and the bottom circle is for the catch all.

Remember from the prior exercise we showed an API that looked like the following:
`http://[hostname]]/resources/ecs/IBM/demo/[store prefix]_[item number]`

Because the "isNumerical" is passing a number and the "set store_prefix" is setting the store name we have both pieces of information we need for the API.

The JSON object that gets created from the "set store_prefix" and from the "inject" nodes is the following:

```JSON
{
"store_prefix":"sample_store",
"payload":"19645922"
}
```

So now we want to create the URL by using the "Mustache" syntax.

`http://[hostname]]/resources/ecs/IBM/demo/{{{store_prefix}}}_{{{payload}}}`

This will take the "store_prefix" JSON value and the "payload" JSON value and add it to the end of the URL. We now need to add the http request to invoke the URL.

Drag the **http request** node from the pallet to the flow editor.

![Architecture Overview](/images/http-request-node.png)

 Now **double click** the node.

![Architecture Overview](/images/http-request-editor-node.png)


Change the name of the node to "item lookup".

![Architecture Overview](/images/item-lookup-node.png)

Also paste the following url into the URL field.

`http://mvs1.centers.ihost.com:50200/resources/ecs/IBM/demo/{{{store_prefix}}}_{{{payload}}}`

![Architecture Overview](/images/item-lookup-detail.png)

Make sure to change the "Return" value from **"a UTF-8 string" to "a parsed JSON object"**

Close the detail view of the "item Lookup" node.

Create a link between the top circle of the switch "isNumerical" and the left side of the "Item look up".

![Architecture Overview](/images/connect-switch-item-node.png)


Create a connection between the "Item lookup" and "Translate Debug" nodes. This will allow us to see what is returned from invoking the API.

![Architecture Overview](/images/connect-item-node-debug-node.png)

Click the **Deploy** button at the top of the screen.

![Architecture Overview](/images/deploy-button.png)

This will push your updates to the server on BlueMix.


Next, click on the left side of the **Inject** node that has "19645922". This causes the inject to be fired and the flow to be executed. Make sure the debug node is toggled to display the output.

![Architecture Overview](/images/inject-itemid-node.png)

You should see something like the following in the debug window on the right side:

![Architecture Overview](/images/item-lookup-debug-output.png)

Okay, as you can see there is a JSON result coming from the API call.
```JSON
{
	"inventory":24,
	"price":"49.98",
	"name":"Rainjacket",
	"min_stock":35,
	"location_code":"466.014.812"
}
```

Remember our newly create REST API is supposed to only return the "Name" of a product when supplied with a "ItemID". So we need to clean up the JSON response to only return the "Name" value. To do this we need to drag the "Function" node from the pallet to the editor.

![Architecture Overview](/images/function-node-pallet.png)

Next delete the link between the "Item Lookup" node and the "Translate Debug" node. Create a new connection between the "Item Lookup" and the newly dropped "Function" node.
Then connect the **right** side of the function node to the "Translate Debug" Node and the "Return Translated Name/Number" node.

![Architecture Overview](/images/item-parse-debug-flow.png)

Change the name of the "Function" node to "Parse out Name". This is done by double clicking on the "Function" node and changing the name. Your function node editor view should look like:

![Architecture Overview](/images/parse-out-name-node.png)

Make sure to paste the following code into the function editor

```Javascript
	msg.payload = msg.payload.name;
	return msg;
```

Click **Done** when finished.


The above code is taking the results "msg.payload.name" from the JSON that was returned from the API call and reassigning the "msg.payload" with the name value. This is because our newly created REST API is only supposed to return a name, if the itemID is supplied.

Now connect the "Parse out Name" function to the "Translate Debug" node and to the "Return Translated Name/Number" http response node.

![Architecture Overview](/images/parse-out-name-flow.png)

Click the **Deploy** button at the top of the screen.

![Architecture Overview](/images/deploy-button.png)

This will push your updates to the server on BlueMix.

Next, click on the left side of the **Inject** node that has "19645922". This causes the inject to be fired and the flow to be executed.

![Architecture Overview](/images/inject-itemid-node.png)

You should see something like the following in the debug window on the right side:

![Architecture Overview](/images/parse-out-name-debug.png)

As you can see the response is just the name now, not the rest of the JSON object.
Don't worry about the "No response object" message shows.


Next we are going to do the same thing as we just did, but now for translating a "product name" into a "itemID".


Drag the **http request** node from the pallet to the flow editor.

![Architecture Overview](/images/http-request-node.png)

 Now **double click** the node.

![Architecture Overview](/images/http-request-editor-node.png)


Change the name of the node to "name lookup" and add the following URL:

``http://mvs1.centers.ihost.com:50200/resources/ecs/IBM/demo/{{{payload}}}``

Notice in this URL the only attribute we are looking for is the "payload". The store number isn't needed. Aslo, make sure to change the "Return" value from "a UTF-8 string" to "a parsed JSON object".

Click **Done** when finished.

Next connect to the bottom circle from "isNumerical" to the left side of your new Http Request node "Name Lookup"

![Architecture Overview](/images/connect-switch-namelookup-flow.png)

Now connect the "name lookup" to the "Parse out Itemid". You are just about done.

![Architecture Overview](/images/connect-namelookup-parseid-flow.png)

Click the **Deploy** button at the top of the screen.

![Architecture Overview](/images/deploy-button.png)

Now click on the **generator** inject node.

![Architecture Overview](/images/inject-generator-node.png)

You should now see something like the following in the debug panel on the right side of the page:

![Architecture Overview](/images/generator-flow-debug.png)

Okay your final flow should look something like the following:

![Architecture Overview](/images/exercise-two-full-flow.png)

You have created another new API for others to call. So when someone wants to translate from item_number to an item_name and vice versa they cal call your API.

`https://STSAWorkshops-xx.mybluemix.net/translate`

Congrats you have completed exercise 2. The completed new service will make it easy for a developer to translate back and forth between item names and numbers.



## Exercise 3:
Start a new tab in Node-RED, and paste in the nodes for Exercise 3.

In the right corner is a "plus sign". Click it to add a new flow within NodeRed.

![Architecture Overview](/images/new-flow-plus-sign.png)

Copy the code below and paste it into the new flow.

Your screen should look something like the following. You might have to move the copied flow around to make it more visible.

![Architecture Overview](/images/exercise-three-start-flow.png)

This is a big one, and makes use of both Weather Channel data, as well as the product information we have made available through our previous two exercises.

The first thing to do is get your weather data http requests working. By default (and with good reason!),
Node-RED does not export user credentials when you import/export, so you’ll have to enter in your own credentials here.
These are not your w3 credentials, but the username/password specific to the Weather Channel Data service, which you’ll create in the next step.

Go to bluemix.net and head over to Catalog, which will show you the list of services available.
Find “Weather Company Data”, under Data & Analytics. Click on the tile to create the service

![Architecture Overview](/images/bluemix-weather-tile.png)

Create a new instance of this service, accepting the defaults or give the service a unique name. Click **Create** when done.

You should now have your newly created weather service on your BlueMix dashboard. Click on the newly created service

![Architecture Overview](/images/bluemix-dashboard-weather.png)

On the left-hand side, find “Service Credentials”and then “View Credentials”, which is where you’ll find the username/password.

![Architecture Overview](/images/bluemix-weather-credentials.png)

Go back to your newly created "NodeRed flow". There are two "http request" nodes that need to be updated.
These nodes are pointing to the weather.com REST API's. They need to have the credentials added, so you can invoke the API's.

![Architecture Overview](/images/http-request-weather-nodes.png)

Double click on the **http request** to the right of the  "json" node. This "http request" node is calling the weather.com API to locate geo coordinates for a city. In our case, the city name is "Dallas".
So a city name is sent into the http request the longitude and latitude are returned from the API. In order for the node to work properly, you need to click on the **Use basic authentication** button.

![Architecture Overview](/images/http-request-node-detail-basicauth.png)

Paste your **username** and **password** from your weather BlueMix service.

![Architecture Overview](/images/http-request-node-detail-basicauth-filled.png)

Enter this same information into the other "http request" node. This second node is used to call the "48 hour" forecast, for a geo location. Remember the geo location came from the prior http request to the weather API.

![Architecture Overview](/images/http-request-node-detail-url-forecast.png)


With your credentials entered, you should be able to access a web page by heading to [name].mybluemix.net/weather. Where [name] is the application name from your NodeRed application. It should be something like STSAWorkshops-xx.

It will return a list of weather-related items.

Note: You'll note that the page returns in a different order each time. This is because calls made after the "Split" node are being made asynchronously and returned as soon as they complete. If order were important, we could write a function to order them.

Right now, the page is only showing five items, but the inventory actually has ten weather-related items. Update the page so it shows information for all of them. The keys for these items are:
umbrella, generator, rainjacket, flashlight, batteries, bucket, sumppump, boots, ducttape, water.

## Exercise 4:
We need to highlight the weather-related items that are below recommended inventory levels prior to a rainy day. You may notice the "Check Weather Status" and "Check Reorder Status" nodes, which are Switch statements. Use these to determine first, if the probability of rain is above a certain value (your choosing), and if so, then check to see if the current inventory is below the "Minimum Stock" value. If both of these evaluate to true, route the flow through the "Add Rain Icon" node, otherwise, continue the flow to the "Join" node below.
![Architecture Overview](/images/two_switch_nodes.png)



If you need help finding the values for these comparisons, check the various Function nodes where we moved values out of payload and into other objects. Also, if you're having trouble figuring out the correct keys to use for the store inventory, turn on the CICS debug node for the full output, which should contain some clues.

## Exercise 5:
Okay now is the time to leverage our skills from the prior workshops. Lets see if you can connect Watson Conversation Service to your newly created flows.
#### In Watson Conversation
1. Create a new Intent and call it **Inventory Lookup**. Make sure to create examples of how you think a user will ask about the products.
2. Create a new Entity and call it **Products**. Add the products from exercise 3 above.
3. Create a dialog flow that will respond to a request for the inventory amount for a generator. **Remember** to add an "output.action" value in the response dialog node in WCS. Maybe call it "product-inventory-lookup"

#### In NodeRed
1. Update your NodeRed WCS flow and add a new switch option in the "Conversation Actions" node. This should have a new condition looking to the value of "output.action" from step 3. (product-inventory-lookup)
2. Connect the output of the "Conversation Action" and the API from exercises 1 and 2 for both "TranslateItem" and then "Inventory Lookup". Remember you need to call both API's. Since you will be getting a product name from WCS, you will need to call the TranslateItem first, and then use the result to call Inventory Lookup.
3. Based on the response from the Inventory API call, copy the inventory value into your Watson Conversation response. Look at **CurrentTempCelcius** node as an example to mimic.

#### Logical Flow
The node flow should be something like:

 **Conversation Action** -> **Function to get product name from WCS entity** -> **http request to TranslateItem api** -> **Function to get ItemID** -> **http request to Inventory Lookup API** -> **function to copy inventory value into the wcs output.text** -> **http node**  


## Exercise 6:
You probably noticed there were a few fields in the key/value store that were not used, such as tags, and location code. There is also a ton of information returned from the Weather Channel Data service that we didn't use for this example.

What are some ways the page, or the individual services, could be improved by taking into consideration this additional data? Or, using the data that we already have, what additional services could we provide to developers who are building their own applications?

What are some situations where you would want to update data as well as read it, and how might you go about implementing that in a Node-RED flow?
